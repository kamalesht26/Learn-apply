Data types 
-----------

It is used to building block of our code

*int eg 3, 300 
*float eg 3.3, 33.0
*str ( both character and number ) eg "kamalesh", 'kam',"200", "any other lang"

*set (unordered collection of unique objects) eg {"a","b"}
*bool (logical value indication True or False)


1/2 = 0 to get proper ans follow below steps

either we have to follow 1.0/2 or float(1)/2 or from __future__ import division
